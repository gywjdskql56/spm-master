  description: `Blockchain will play a key role in the global medical environment where foreign patients are treated by excellent medical staff in Korea and receive remote health care abroad.`,
  content: `Director Kwang-Ryeol Lee of Nanuri Hospital, a spine and joint specialist hospital, emphasized that blockchain will be a great weapon to increase the reliability of medical data management ahead of the launch of 'MT-ChainUs,' the first global integrated patient management solution based on blockchain in Korea. .MT Chainers is a medical information management blockchain solution jointly developed by Nanuri Hospital's medical staff and blockchain startup Tobico Co., Ltd. When foreign patients use this program, they can upload various medical information such as their symptoms and medical images from their home hospital to receive a diagnosis from excellent medical staff in Korea. After the patient has been treated in Korea and returned home, the doctor in Korea can check the patient's recovery and set up a rehabilitation plan. In addition, the fact that it was developed by reviewing various treatment processes actually in progress at Nanoori Hospital and all kinds of requests from overseas patients, contains the vivid voice of the medical field, and the advantage is that all information is managed stably and transparently based on blockchain technology. there is.◆ What issues should be considered in the medical blockchain business?
  Many healthcare blockchain projects are overly focused on data collection. But focusing on data collection and trading is risky. If you think of patients suffering from various diseases, you should avoid blockchain businesses that aim to collect and sell indiscriminate data. Since medical records contain personal information and disease information, if unauthorized organizations randomly collect medical data, they will face complex issues surrounding sensitive information, including forgery and falsification. There are many risk factors to consider when collecting data or planning transactions in the name of health care.◆ Including MT Chainers, what differentiates Health Chainers?
  Unlike other projects, Health Chainers is a project that separates health management and disease management and is conducted based on thorough medical evidence. Rather than indiscriminate data collection or transaction, we are presenting a solution that is essential from the patient's point of view. For this reason, many doctors are involved in this project. It is expected that many hospitals and medical personnel who sympathize with the purpose of HealthChainers, which is to restore trust between hospitals and patients, will continue to participate.
  ◆ What is the future prospect of Health Chainers?
  Medical data is a risk factor such as leakage, which is difficult for hospitals or medical personnel to handle. Health Chainers has carefully reviewed these practical difficulties that its partners will face. We are also aware of the impact blockchain will have on the medical field.`,
